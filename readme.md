# BASED OFF RAYFIELD VERSION: v1.68
## Latest `RayfieldCustom-` Build: 17
## (Based off Rayfield commit [`20a86c28d599ca572bad26223ffffc9bd3f2f2df`](https://github.com/SiriusSoftwareLtd/Rayfield/commit/20a86c28d599ca572bad26223ffffc9bd3f2f2df))

## NOTE: The main branch is currently UNTESTED, and may error, fail to do it's job properly, or be very buggy. If the main branch dosent work for you, you can try the [`older-but-more-stable`](https://github.com/zombi-dev/RayfieldCustom-/tree/older-but-more-stable) branch!
## NOTE: This is now only updated once in a millenia, as I have WAYY bigger things to work on than this, although when I feel bored I may just update it (but I won't probably test it).

# What is this?
- This is a forked version of Rayfield for own (personal) use, that adds/changes a couple things. This probably still works alongside the actual Rayfield library.
- This works with hopes and dreams tbh, and does a lot of weird stuff and uses cheap and dumb hacks.
- See the original: [SiriusSoftwareLtd/Rayfield](https://github.com/SiriusSoftwareLtd/Rayfield)
